# Lab 03: FS and Async

## Project Requirements
Create a 'readFiles' module that will read an array of filepaths in parallel, and return an array of the file contents

Create a CLI that uses this file reading module to print the contents of a list of files provided on process.argv

Also, guarantee that three files are read and console logged in the order they were passed in on process.argv


## Tests
Write a test that guarantees your readFiles module will read all of the files passed in

Write a test that guarantees your CLI prints the files in the order that the filepath arguments were provided
